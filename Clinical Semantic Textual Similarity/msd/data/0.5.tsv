Outcome is better for patients hospitalized because of elective procedures ( eg , joint replacement ) than for those hospitalized because of serious disorders ( eg , multisystem organ failure ) .	This therapy also applies to people undergoing some other operations in which infections are particularly problematic ( for example , joint or heart valve replacement ) .	0.0
Also , the pulmonary vasculature develops abnormally , with fewer and/or abnormally distributed alveolar capillaries ; pulmonary resistance may be increased and pulmonary hypertension can develop ( 1 ) .	This constriction and thickening increase the pressure in the pulmonary arteries .	1.0
Complications such as bleeding , perforation , and cancer are unusual .	Complications of laparoscopy include bleeding , infection , and perforation .	3.0
Some patients benefit from hospitalization , during which continuous support and monitoring are provided as painful memories are addressed .	Because of the often intense anxiety associated with traumatic memories , it is important for the people to feel supported and for the exposure to proceed at the right pace .	2.0
The main concern is malignant transformation , which occurs at different rates depending on the size and type of polyp .	Polyps vary considerably in size , and the bigger the polyp , the greater the risk that it is cancerous or likely to become cancerous ( that is , they are precancerous ) .	4.0
TMJ dysfunction is a common cause of earache in patients with a normal ear examination .	If no abnormalities are found during the ear examination but the person has chronic pain , doctors sometimes suspect the ear pain might be due to a TMJ disorder .	3.0
