Urine glucose monitoring is too inaccurate to be recommended .	Urine testing can be misleading because the amount of glucose in the urine may not reflect the current level of glucose in the blood .	3.5
If the mutation is known , molecular genetic techniques can identify heterozygous phenotypically normal people ( eg , most of the time , people with cystic fibrosis ) .	In addition , because typical genetic testing does not look for all of the more than 1,900 different cystic fibrosis mutations , failure to detect two mutations does not guarantee the person does not have cystic fibrosis ( although the chance of having cystic fibrosis is very low ) .	2.5
Bronchial carcinoma can lead to obstruction that causes pneumonia and abscess formation .	Usually , people develop only one lung abscess as a result of aspiration or airway obstruction .	0.5

Sometimes combinations of findings suggest a cause ( see table Findings Related to Weakness Suggesting a Specific Disorder ) .	People may have other symptoms depending on what is causing the weakness .	1.5
Chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) is life -altering fatigue lasting > 6 mo that typically affects previously healthy and active people ; it is not malingering .	Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disorder of unknown cause that results in fatigue and certain other symptoms .	3.0
Paraphimosis should be reduced immediately because the constricting foreskin functions as a tourniquet , causing edema and pain .	In paraphimosis , the retracted foreskin can not be pulled forward to cover the glans penis .	0.5
Gastric emptying is considered if it can be done within 1 h of a life -threatening ingestion .	Stomach emptying ( inducing vomiting or stomach pumping ) , once commonly done , is now usually avoided because it removes only a small amount of the poison and can cause serious complications .	0.5
Ehrlichiosis is caused mainly by Ehrlichia chaffeensis ; anaplasmosis is caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum .	Symptoms of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are similar , but anaplasmosis is less likely to cause a rash .	2.0
Symptoms are rarely intense in such chronic mycoses , but fever , chills , night sweats , anorexia , weight loss , malaise , and depression may occur .	Symptoms include weight loss , night sweats , a mild fever , and a general feeling of illness ( malaise ) .	4.0

Recurrent tumors can be treated with another course of radiation , commonly with brachytherapy ( radioactive implant placement ) ; radionecrosis of the skull base is a risk .	Combined treatment with brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy is sometimes recommended for more aggressive cancers .	1.5
Most patients , especially those with lytic lesions and generalized osteoporosis or osteopenia , should receive a monthly IV bisphosphonate ( either pamidronate or zoledronic acid ) .	Bisphosphonates ( used to treat osteoporosis ) , such as pamidronate or zoledronate , reduce bone pain and bone loss and may prevent or delay bone problems that can result when cancer spreads to bone .	2.5
Other symptoms of venous or arterial thrombosis may also develop .	Sometimes people who have very extensive superficial venous thrombosis are also given heparin or a different anticoagulant to help limit the blood 's clotting .	1.5
Oral appliances are designed to advance the mandible or , at the very least , prevent retrusion during sleep .	These devices are more uncomfortable than mandibular advancement devices .	2.5

Intravenous corticosteroids have been reported to delay onset of multiple sclerosis for at least 2 years .	Although corticosteroids may shorten relapses and slow the progression of multiple sclerosis , they do not stop its progression .	2.0
Compliance can be decreased by repeated infections or by outlet obstruction , with resulting bladder muscle hypertrophy .	Treatment depends on whether the cause is bladder outlet obstruction , weak bladder wall muscles , or both .	2.0
These drugs reduce risk of seizures during the first week after injury but do not prevent permanent posttraumatic epilepsy months or years later .	During status epilepticus , the seizures may be continuous or the child may have seizures that repeat at brief intervals without the child regaining consciousness in-between seizures .	1.0
The developing edema and exudate result in partial obstruction , which is most pronounced on expiration and leads to alveolar air trapping .	In emphysema , the destruction of alveolar wall attachments results in collapse of the bronchioles when a person exhales , causing airflow obstruction that is permanent and irreversible .	2.0
Nearly all are acquired abroad , but a small number result from blood transfusions or rarely from transmission by local mosquitoes that feed on infected immigrants or returning travelers .	However , a few result from blood transfusions or from the bite of a mosquito that had bitten an infected immigrant or returning traveler .	1.0
Burning mouth syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion once other causes have been ruled out .	Burning mouth syndrome probably represents a number of different conditions with different causes but a common symptom .	2.0
l-Thyroxine is contraindicated in older patients with nontoxic nodular goiter , because these goiters rarely shrink and may harbor areas of autonomy so that l-thyroxine therapy can result in hyperthyroidism .	Less common causes include growths ( nodules ) on the thyroid gland , inflammation of the thyroid gland ( thyroiditis in which hyperthyroidism is temporary , being followed by hypothyroidism ) , and some drugs .	0.0
Treat chronic hepatitis C of all genotypes with interferon -free regimens of direct -acting antivirals .	There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis D , but chronic hepatitis D may be treated with interferon alfa .	0.0
If the patient is stable and clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancy is low , serial beta- hCG levels may be done on an outpatient basis .	If the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy is low , hCG levels are measured periodically .	4.0
Instructing patients to bring all drug containers to the office can help identify drugs that increase risk .	A pharmacist can provide containers that help people take drugs as instructed .	0.0
Minor cutaneous abscesses may require only incision and drainage .	Abscesses may also form after surgery to repair a serious abdominal injury .	2.0
Food can be contaminated by staphylococcal carriers or people with active skin infections .	The staphylococci bacteria grow in food , in which they produce toxins .	1.0
The onset may be rapid or gradual with loss of purposeful hand skills and spoken language .	Development of motor and language skills may be delayed .	0.0
If it is not inserted during this time frame , a backup contraceptive method should be used concurrently for at least 7 days .	If more than 2 days go without using the patch , women should use a backup contraceptive method for 7 days in addition to the patch .	4.0
Under sterile technique , the area is anesthetized to the peritoneum with lidocaine 1 % .	This procedure is painful , so an anesthetic ( such as lidocaine 5 % ointment ) is often applied .	2.0
The increase in urine osmolality is 50 to 100 % in central diabetes insipidus vs 15 to 45 % with partial central diabetes insipidus .	If too little antidiuretic hormone is produced ( a condition called central diabetes insipidus ) or if the kidneys are unable to properly respond to it ( nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ) , the person urinates excessively .	3.0
Several cases resulted in significant morbidity , including blindness .	In some people , the disorder becomes chronic and progressively worse , increasing the risk of blindness .	2.0
Muscles of the hands , feet , and face are not involved except in inclusion body myositis , in which distal involvement , especially of the hands , is characteristic .	The muscles of the hands , feet , and face , however , are not usually affected .	3.0
In some patients , aphasia is the only symptom for ≥ 10 yr ; in others , global deficits develop within a few years .	Some types of dementia can also cause aphasia that progressively worsens .	2.0
In this situation , if abnormal soft tissue is found on examination of the ear canal , the tissue must be biopsied to rule out cancer .	If abnormal tissue is present in the ear canal , a tissue sample ( biopsy ) may be taken .	4.0
Initially , lesions have a dendriform appearance resembling herpes simplex keratitis .	Treatment of herpes simplex keratitis should be started as soon as possible .	2.0
Typically , an autosomal dominant disorder is expected to be present in one or both parents of an affected person .	This dystrophy is a rare autosomal dominant disorder ( only one affected parent is needed to pass the trait on to offspring ) that affects males and females .	3.0
The nails typically are deformed and discolored white or yellow .	In more severe infections , the nails thicken and appear deformed and discolored .	4.0
There is an increased risk of bleeding and arterial or venous thrombosis .	A few increase the risk of clot formation in both arteries and veins .	3.0
Fetal cells are sometimes detected in patients who do not have the amniotic fluid embolism .	Amniotic fluid embolism occurs when some amniotic fluid ( the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the uterus ) that contains cells or tissue from the fetus enters the woman ’ s bloodstream and causes a serious reaction in the woman .	3.0
If initial systolic BP is > 160 mm Hg , 2 drugs should be initiated regardless of lifestyle .	For people with blood pressure at or above 140/90 mm Hg , usually two drugs are started at the same time .	3.0

Standard intensive care units ( ICUs ) in public hospitals are not suitable .	Intensive care units ( ICUs ) can be even more confusing .	4.0
IL-10 is produced by B cells , macrophages , monocytes , Tc cells , Th2 cells , and regulatory T cells .	Also , natural killer cells produce cytokines that regulate some of the functions of T cells , B cells , and macrophages .	3.0
Diagnosis of GISTs is usually by endoscopy , with biopsy and endoscopic ultrasonography for staging .	Usually , endoscopy ( a visual examination of the digestive tract using a flexible tube called an endoscope ) is done to confirm the diagnosis of a bezoar and to exclude a tumor as the cause .	3.0
If liver function test results ( eg , unexplained elevations in aminotransferase levels ) are compatible with chronic hepatitis , do serologic tests for hepatitis B and C .	Testing for chronic hepatitis B usually begins with blood tests to determine how well the liver is functioning and whether it is damaged ( liver function tests ) .	3.0
The most common tumor of the mandible and maxilla is squamous cell carcinoma invading the bone through dental sockets .	Squamous cell carcinoma , which means the cancer develops in the squamous cells that line the inside of the mouth or throat , is by far the most common type of oral cancer .	3.0
